This is an essay about dogs. I have mixed feelings about dogs. I like some aspects, but others are just really bad. I love the companionship but I hate the neediness. I wish dogs could give back more than just cuteness. They don't pay taxes, they don't do chores, they just make messes and are really loud. I do like them for hunting, police work, or herding, but I don't do any of that.
