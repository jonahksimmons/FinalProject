# FinalProject
Final project for AP Computer Science A class

This is essiantially a Linux terminal that can just
do file management for all you Windows nerds.

This is basically a text version of FileExplorer.
It can make files, write to files, read files, 
remove files, create directories (folders), remove
directories.


This was a lot of fun learning all the needed syntax
and fun making. I hope you enjoy.
